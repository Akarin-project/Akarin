# This is the help configuration file for Bukkit.
# By default you do not need to modify this file. Help topics for all plugin commands are automatically provided by
# or extracted from your installed plugins. You only need to modify this file if you wish to add new help pages to
# your server or override the help pages of existing plugin commands.
# --
# This file is divided up into the following parts:
# -- general-topics: lists admin defined topics
# -- amend-topics:   lists topic amendments to apply to existing help topics
# -- ignore-plugins: lists any plugins that should be excluded from help
# general-topics and command-topics respectively.
# Examples are given below. Color codes are allowed. When amending command topic, the string <text> will be replaced
# with the existing value in the help topic.
# --
# Each general topic will show up as a separate topic in the help index along with all the plugin command topics.
# general-topics:
#     rules:
#         shortText: Rules of the server
#         fullText: |
#             1. Be kind to your fellow players.
#             2. No griefing.
#             3. No swearing.
#         permission: topics.rules
# --
# Topic amendments are used to change the content of automatically generated plugin command topics.
# amended-topics:
#     /stop:
#         shortText: Stops the server cold....in its tracks!
#         fullText: <text> - This kills the server.
#         permission: you.dont.have
# --
# Any plugin in the ignored plugins list will be excluded from help. The name must match the name displayed by
# the /plugins command. Ignore "Bukkit" to remove the standard bukkit commands from the index.
# ignore-plugins:
#    - PluginNameOne
#    - PluginNameTwo
#    - PluginNameThree
