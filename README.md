Akarin is currently **under heavy development** and contributions are welcome!

Introduction
---

> Akarin is a powerful server software from the 'new dimension', formerly known as Torch.

As a [Paper](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper) fork, it should support almost all plugins that work on [Spigot](https://hub.spigotmc.org/stash/projects/SPIGOT/repos/spigot/browse).

Our project has a few key goals:

* **Open Access** - Make more game mechanics configurable.
* **Bedrock** - Make the server more safe and stable.
* **Fast** - Simplify the logic and implement multi-threaded computing.

*Issues and Pull Requests will be labeled accordingly*

* You must use `--setup` at least once to deploy necessary dependencies otherwise some imports cannot be organized.
* For non-modified projects, it is recommended to add the `--fast` option to skip any tests.
* If your machine has insufficient memory, you may want to add the `--remote` option to avoid decompiling locally.
