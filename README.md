CraftBukkit
===========

A Bukkit (Minecraft Server API) implementation

Compilation
-----------

We use maven to handle our dependencies.

* Install [Maven 3](http://maven.apache.org/download.html)
* Check out and install [Bukkit](http://github.com/Bukkit/Bukkit)
    * *Note*: this is not needed as the repository we use has Bukkit too, but you might have a newer one (with your own changes :D)
* Check out this repo and: `mvn clean package`
